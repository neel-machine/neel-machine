### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , Welcome to my Github profile.

I am Neelima , currently pursuing Master's in ML/AI at Liverpool John Moores University. This account consists of some ML/AI projects I have done ,check out my [Portfolio](https://neel-machine.github.io/project_portfolio/) for the gist. (I am updating the portfolio at present).

In my free time I listen to music, try to workout regularly :smiley: and spend time hanging out with friends and family.
